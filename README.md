## Projects
**1. Mall Customer Segmentation**

<div><p>The Customer Segmentation & Understanding project was created to meet the pressing need for businesses to comprehend and adapt to their consumers' different preferences. It uses unsupervised machine learning techniques. In today's highly competitive industry, this insight is critical for efficiently adapting products and marketing strategies. Using powerful machine learning algorithms, the initiative divided clients into meaningful groups based on common qualities and behaviors allowing for a better understanding of their interests and actions. It also led to enhanced marketing ROI.</p>
<p>Technologies: K-Means, DBScan, Jenkins, MLflow, Azure DevOps</p></div>

**3. Banking Bot**

<div><p>I developed a bot leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to address various banking-related issues and queries. This bot serves as a mobile application that provides comprehensive assistance to users regarding their banking needs. The key objectives of the bot include resolving queries related to account information, transaction details, security services, loan policies, and account status updates. Additionally, it monitors transaction activities in real-time to identify and alert users about suspicious or fraudulent activities, empowering them to take necessary precautions and report incidents promptly. By providing quick and accurate responses to users' banking queries, it reduced the need for human intervention, resulting in faster resolution of issues and improved customer satisfaction</p>
