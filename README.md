## Projects
**1. Product Rating Prediction**

<div><p>Developed a predictive model that can anticipate whether a customer liked or disliked a product based on their purchase behavior. In many cases, customers do not provide feedback or reviews after purchasing a product, making it difficult for the platform to assess customer preferences accurately. After analyzing historical data on product purchases and customer interactions, the model predicts the rating a user would assign to a product after making a purchase. This prediction enables the e-commerce platform to recommend similar or related products to customers and make informed decisions about product offerings.</p>

**2. Backorder Prediction**

<div><p>Developed a predictive model for backorder prediction using machine learning technology in the domain of e-commerce. Leveraging historical data from inventories, supply chains, and sales, the model classifies products as either likely to go into backorder or not. By anticipating potential backorders, the model aids in streamlining planning processes across production, logistics, and transportation, thereby preventing unexpected strain on operations. </p>

**3. Mall Customer Segmentation**

<div><p>The Customer Segmentation & Understanding project was created to meet the pressing need for businesses to comprehend and adapt to their consumers' different preferences. It uses unsupervised machine learning techniques. In today's highly competitive industry, this insight is critical for efficiently adapting products and marketing strategies. Using powerful machine learning algorithms, the initiative divided clients into meaningful groups based on common qualities and behaviors allowing for a better understanding of their interests and actions. It also led to enhanced marketing ROI.</p>

**5. Insurance Claim Management**

<div><p>To streamline the process of insurance claim administration, we created an automated system that uses deep learning, NLP, and computer vision techniques. The technology successfully matches submitted documents to their original format, extracts handwritten and digital text, and populates pertinent fields in claim forms, minimizing manual work and increasing efficiency.</p>

**6. Banking Bot**

<div><p>I developed a bot leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques to address various banking-related issues and queries. This bot serves as a mobile application that provides comprehensive assistance to users regarding their banking needs. The key objectives of the bot include resolving queries related to account information, transaction details, security services, loan policies, and account status updates. Additionally, it monitors transaction activities in real-time to identify and alert users about suspicious or fraudulent activities, empowering them to take necessary precautions and report incidents promptly. By providing quick and accurate responses to users' banking queries, it reduced the need for human intervention, resulting in faster resolution of issues and improved customer satisfaction</p>
